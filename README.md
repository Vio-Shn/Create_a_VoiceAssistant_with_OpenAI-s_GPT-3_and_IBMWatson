### What I learn from this Project :
A virtual assistant is a program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet using natural human voice. 
Assistants can be used in a variety of industries, including customer service, e-commerce, and education.

- Understand the basics of voice assistants and their various applications
- Set up a development environment for building an assistant using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Implement speech-to-text functionality to allow the assistant to understand voice input from users
- Integrate the assistant with OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3 model to give it a high level of intelligence and the ability to understand and respond to user requests
- Implement text-to-speech functionality to allow the assistant to communicate with users through voice output
- Combine all of the above components to create a functioning assistant that can take voice input and provide a spoken response
